# CFPB-Consumer-Complaints-Database-Analysis
The Consumer Complaint Database maintained by the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (CFPB) has been used to log and track the complaints against various financial companies, banks, debt collectors and more. The new leadership at CFPB is reviewing whether the public database will be continued. This report provides an analysis and evaluation of the Consumers Complaint Database maintained by the CFPB since July 2011 and evidence to substantiate recommendations to allow continued public access to the database. Exploratory data analysis performed on the Hadoop ecosystem using Cloudera and Apache Pyspark include trend, horizontal and vertical analysis as well as ratios such as Company Response Time and Consumer Dispute Rate ratio. The report also takes a closer look at the observations during the 2017 Equifax Data Breach incident for valuable insights into the companyâ€™s response as well as the impact of the breach incident.
